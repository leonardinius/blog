I by no means am no system administrator or SCM guy or DBA guy or whatever.  My
job duties mostly consist from system analysis and design, architecture,
implementation and delivery. I would call myself _Developer vulgaris_. Still, I
used to find myself in position I have working (locally) solution and little or
no clue how the heck to get it out in window. Should I just throw it to admins,
let them handle that and hope it won't break?

Yup, I might. And it works perfectly well. Until... until you are small
consultant venture with 3-5 team members and no additional separate
support/admin team to poke issues to. 

I myself don't religiously believe system administrators are extinct creatures
from Age of Reptiles and don't think that in-team administration/maintenance
experience is a MUST.  In my humble opinion in some cases it makes more sense
to outsource application maintenance or use PAAS, however in some cases it
doesn't. It depends on scope, budget, difficulty, level of expertise required,
average Joe on the team et cetera. 

To sum up, in some cases it's up to external stuff you can't control (budget,
client wishes..) and in some cases it's team internal decision. In later case
the real question is - _Is Application/System management your Core Competence?
You don't want to outsource that_.
