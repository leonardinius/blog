In the <a href="http://leonardinius.blogspot.com/2008/09/draft-to-update-clamour-and-stir-around.html">previous post</a> I was mentioned rumors around Google Chrome WWW browser. Today I have discovered that Google is actually prepared for launching it on September 2/3 and is only hiding that info from us :)<br /><br />Try this <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;rls=ig&amp;q=download+google+chrome+site:.google.com&amp;start=0&amp;sa=N">search shortcut</a>. You'll see several links to google pages (which on open are empty though, pity).<br />One interesting note:<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Y9XTlNGJRTQ/SLz9yfjPUSI/AAAAAAAAB6s/DTB3FYS2wkc/s1600-h/2008-09-02_1143.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Y9XTlNGJRTQ/SLz9yfjPUSI/AAAAAAAAB6s/y7XNwSaqMJU/s400-R/2008-09-02_1143.png" /></a></div>You see: september 3. Hmm May be it's local time somewhere, or maybe just foreseeing :D We will see, we will.
