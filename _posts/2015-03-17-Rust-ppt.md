title: "The SWEET flavour of Rust (presentation)"
layout: post
---

I accidentally ended up presenting about Rust at [Latcraft][1]'s
[March event][2] (the event was devoted to Rust, GoLang and Erlang).

It all started with the tweet from [Latcraft][1] org people.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/leonardinius">@leonardinius</a> I&#39;d love to see you presenting at <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/latcraft?src=hash">#latcraft</a> in front of ~100 colleagues - should be motivating enough! Mb Rust lang next year?</p>&mdash; Eduards Sizovs (@eduardsi) <a href="https://twitter.com/eduardsi/status/542342405669015552">December 9, 2014</a></blockquote>

And then the race (preparation et cetera) was on ;) Only regret: Will reserve
more time for talk polishing next time.  Unfortunately, guys screwed up video,
so I don't have one.

## tl; dr; ###

**Agenda**
> Every chef now and then uses pinch of his secret spices to make a dish
> somewhat special and exquisite. This talk will provide introduction into
> nature of Rust sweetness and will answer to most important questions: Why and
> When does it make our dishes better? We will iterate over small code snippets
> and take a look How strong typing and functional thinking can be applied to
> low level system programming.
