<a href="http://code.google.com/p/anti-plagiarism/">Anti-Plagiarism app.</a><br />You can see my <a href="http://sick-weasel.blogspot.com/2008/05/anti-plagiarism-development-session.html">previous post</a> about UI mockups etc. I started to implement system on the Make Design-Realize Functional Requirements-Draw System Mockups-Implement ...<br /><br />Even after first several tryouts I realize struggling a lot in even in the first phase (UI isn't my strongest point).<br />So.. I can see several alternatives at the moment:<br /><ul><li>I can make my UI beautiful and make it look like *.png or some free html templates available. Consequences (as far I can see now):<br /></li><ul><li>I will cut down the choice of the Rich Ajax UIs components (JBoss Richfaces or similar ...);</li><li>Or I will spend  <span style="font-weight: bold;">TOO</span> much time on making them look like custom PNG. It should be UI designer work and should be done after implementing system functionality;</li></ul></ul><ul><li>I can do my best with built-in skinning and JBoss RichFaces or using smth. different control-set. So... First things first. I think, that system functionality is first priority. If anybody will like that, than we sosmehow will manage to make it look beauty.<br /></li></ul>
