I would like to share my joy and interest from an video interview available on infoq - <a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/john-lam-ruby-beyond-rails">"Ruby Beyond Rails"</a>.<br />John Lam talks about IronRuby and in paralell discusses principles developing things. It's not about - get things done. Actually, it is :) But it is moe about - how to live with peace with yourselfes and making you IT work more delightable.<br />Dao principles:<br /><ul><li>Do what matters and what do you care about. You should work on smth important to you.</li><li>Nothing is ideal. Get used to it and let it go.</li><li>Always look for better opprortunities around you (programming languages and so on..)<br /></li><li>Do not fight fans.&nbsp;</li></ul>It's all to make you happier.
