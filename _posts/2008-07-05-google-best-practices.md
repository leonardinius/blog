See <a href="http://www.infoq.com/news/2008/07/Agile-Google-Jeff-Sutherland">Presentation: Agile Project Management: Lessons Learned at Google. </a><br />From a lot of another parts, one item which grabbed my attention:<br />At Google - they have per-person wiki/html page to list the work they are doing now and their plans for the next 3 months. It "helps to share the information and find the right person for the right job/ask question" ...<br /><br />I think it's a wonderful idea an every company which has internal KMP (Knowledge Management Portal) or smth like that should follow this practice. Not making devevlopers to follow this one, but just suggest this. Who knows, may be their staff will like that and theit internal processes and communication will rock :)
