Kind of ;) It's called Anti-Plagiarism and it's hosted on the Google Code - <a href="http://code.google.com/p/anti-plagiarism/">Anti-Plagiarism-On-Google-Code</a>.<br /><br />What I am doing now? I'm trying to think out ALL the Functional requirements, Use cases, UI mockups and to create semi-formal documents/descriptions/Goal list etc...<br /><br />Problems so far:<br /><ul><li>Lack of the experience with advanced plagiarism detection tools (not free, subsriptions are needed etc..)</li><li>UC-es ...</li><li>Ui design (I'm preety horrable in what). So.. I <span style="font-weight: bold;">took</span> some free design available  online and I will try to adjust it to my needs. <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">WRONG! </span>Going from solution to requirements should be avoided.</li><li>Lack of the team/community and lack of the experience with the proposed technology stack....</li></ul><br />For now I' try to think out all the UC and draw UI mockups I see / consider obvious / easy to implement.<br /><br />Afterwards: Step#1 proposal/task list should be created and overviewed.<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">TODO ASAP: </span>Mockups / UC...<br /><br /><br /></div>
