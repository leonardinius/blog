Developers! Developers.</blockquote>Meaning: developers should earn $, $$, $$$ and give some % for him. Nice approach though with some rough corners.<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br /></span><br /><blockquote><span style="font-weight: bold;">Google:</span> Tools! Tools! Tools! </blockquote>Meaning developers, developers, developers. The purpose is - to make developers to use their tools and infrastructure and then get fair % of $ via adverts or smth. I recall their statement: "GWT is not about Java. It's all about tools." It's really a soft-compelling policy (which I actually like) - to make developers happy and gice them possibility to work much more easier and MUCH MORE productive. It all turns out to - "make user happier" policy.<br /><br />So. One more nice solution in th Wide World of Web (recursive acronym, recronym :]]). If all the ideas (that turns out to be the right ones) will be backported into mainstream WWW browsers, than all the user society will be a gainer.
