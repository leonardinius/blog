We all have heard about new upcoming Eclipse release: codename <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/ganymede/learn.php">Ganymede</a> ( <a href="http://www.vogella.de/articles/RichClientPlatform/article.html">tutorial</a> ).<br />Without talking a lot about nothing - I just could point You a great <a href="http://www.infoq.com/news/2008/06/eclipse-ganymede-p2">article</a> to contain all the useful information about this release.<br /><br />From the same article:<br /><blockquote><p> In describing the capabilities that p2 brings to Eclipse, Rapicault said that the 1.0 version of p2 is designed to replace the existing Update Manager (UM). McAffer iterated through several features: </p>  <ol><li>Automatic retry of download across all available sources</li><li>Transparently picks the best mirror</li><li>Bundle pooling allows sharing of plug-ins across multiple eclipse instances</li><li>Ability to manage the complete installation (exe, ini, etc)</li><li>Ability to manage and update an Eclipse instance without running it</li><li>Makes is easy to create headless and custom update user interfaces</li><li>Validates plug-in inter-dependencies so you only install plugins that work together; if you can install it runs</li><li>Multi-threaded download making downloads faster</li><li>Only installs plugins that you need, so it reduces the number of plugins installed</li><li>Create uber-update sites that know how to get plug-ins from multiple sources</li><li>p2 means you never have to install Eclipse again, you just need to update</li><li>An installer that can be run as a regular Java application or using Java Web Start. This installer can be used to install and configure all aspects of Eclipse</li><li>Cleaner end-user workflow</li></ol></blockquote><br />How does it look like? I have tried it myself and I could value it as usable (at least). Of course it has it's rough corners, but it works.<br /><br /><object classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" width="1280" height="818"> <param name="movie" value="http://content.screencast.com/bootstrap.swf"></param> <param name="quality" value="high"></param> <param name="bgcolor" value="#FFFFFF"></param> <param name="flashVars" value="thumb=http://content.screencast.com/media/b1bb892b-0c77-4828-ac50-b0b2fb96f7f5_82f83cf1-5007-4ec8-b805-61f993244ac1_static_0_0_Thumbnail.gif&content=http://content.screencast.com/media/e7c6eb7b-f83f-4e3a-ae64-083a5e0c208e_82f83cf1-5007-4ec8-b805-61f993244ac1_static_0_0_2008-07-04_0244.swf&width=1280&height=818"></param> <param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param> <param name="scale" value="showall"></param> <param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always"></param>  <embed src="http://content.screencast.com/bootstrap.swf" quality="high" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="1280" height="818" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowScriptAccess="always" flashVars="thumb=http://content.screencast.com/media/b1bb892b-0c77-4828-ac50-b0b2fb96f7f5_82f83cf1-5007-4ec8-b805-61f993244ac1_static_0_0_Thumbnail.gif&content=http://content.screencast.com/media/e7c6eb7b-f83f-4e3a-ae64-083a5e0c208e_82f83cf1-5007-4ec8-b805-61f993244ac1_static_0_0_2008-07-04_0244.swf&width=1280&height=818" allowFullScreen="true" scale="showall"></embed> </object><br /><br />At the same time I have 2 more cents to add (as always).<br />Features I do dislike:<br /><ul><li>Installed software just lists plugin, without grouping them<br /></li><li>No support for the extension points I used to utilize very hardly to separate pluginsets logically and physically.</li></ul>Features I would like, improvements:<br /><ul><li>I would like to see one more tab - "Available updates", to see if I have something outdated etc..</li></ul><br />PS. JBoss Tools are working in Ganymede too (with some bugs, haven't time to look into JBOSS JIRA issue tracker to see if they are already known - CNF exception).
