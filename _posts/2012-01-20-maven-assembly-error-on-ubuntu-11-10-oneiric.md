I don't get it. I always expect OSS tools/utils to work correctly on Linux (especially on ubuntu). 
However, in the real life it's often not the case at all.<br />
See&nbsp;<a href="https://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MASSEMBLY-588">https://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MASSEMBLY-588</a>&nbsp;for example (in two words maven assembly fails with some weird exception on Ubuntu while listing folder contents). Weird thing is - it works on Win7 no problem. During this particular project development (I use win7 as development box, this probably is the case) I have seen ~5 cases of weird maven behavior, all of them happend to be on Linux. 
Not judging, just saying.
